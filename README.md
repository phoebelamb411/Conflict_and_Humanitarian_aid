Analysis of conflict deaths vs humanitarian aid (prominent vs underrated conflicts) using UCDP, OCHA, and World Bank data.
# Conflict and Humanitarian Aid Analysis (2024)

This project explores the relationship between reported conflict deaths and humanitarian aid distribution.  
I compared **prominent conflicts** (Ukraine, Israel, Sudan, Syria, Gaza) with **underrated conflicts** (Ethiopia, Mali, Somalia, DRC, Cameroon).  

The goal is to highlight how **humanitarian responses often mirror global attention**, even when suffering does not align with headlines.

- **OCHA Financial Tracking Service** – humanitarian aid funding  
- **World Bank WDI** – population data

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Prominent conflicts often receive proportionally higher humanitarian aid.  
- Underrated conflicts, despite high death tolls, receive less visibility and resources.  
- Aid often mirrors *attention*, not necessarily *need*.

## 💡 Reflection
This is my **first international data project** outside of coursework for my MSBA at Georgetown.  
It reflects my long-term goal of combining **data analytics and international affairs** to highlight both challenges and opportunities in global outreach.
